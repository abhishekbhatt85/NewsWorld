In these application i am using a different Application Architecture.
I had used LifeCylceOwner the new Architecture Companant, Glide for displaying the images, ButterKnife, ConstraintLayout and many more things.

The architecture of the application is design in such a way so that we can achieve the loose coupling between views and controller.Further more these application includes : A class which provides all the dependencies, a Router which will take care of Navigation of the application, a usecase whose soulfull purpose is to provide data from the server.

It includes some of the third party libraries Retrofit with OkHttp, Glide.
